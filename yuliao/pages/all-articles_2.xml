<title>Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees</title>
<link>https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-overwhelmed-by-390000-unconfirmed-transactions-and-surging-fees/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<img width="768" height="432" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddddcccx-768x432.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees" style="float:left;margin:0 15px 15px 0;"><p><strong>In just under two weeks, the number of unconfirmed transactions on the Bitcoin network has skyrocketed from 134,000 to over 390,000, causing a bottleneck in the mempool. This surge in unconfirmed transactions has resulted in a staggering 343% increase in transaction fees, which have risen from $1.99 per transaction on April 26 to a current rate of $8.82 per transaction as of May 7. Bitcoin miners are struggling to keep up with the demand, leaving many users frustrated and unable to complete their transactions in a timely manner.</strong></p> 
<h2>Bitcoin Network Struggles with Unprecedented Traffic and Soaring Fees</h2> 
<p>As of Sunday, May 7, 2023, the Bitcoin network is experiencing a major traffic jam due to an overwhelming number of unconfirmed transactions. The latest statistics reveal that a whopping <a href="https://mempool.space">390,000 transfers</a> are currently stuck in limbo, waiting for confirmation.</p> 
<p>This backlog can be attributed to the surge in minting and transferring of Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20 tokens, which have flooded the network. In fact, the Bitcoin blockchain is now hosting over 13,000 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brc20-token-standard-sparks-frenzy-in-bitcoin-community-with-market-cap-surpassing-95-million/">BRC20 tokens</a> and a staggering 4.17 million Ordinal inscriptions, further exacerbating the congestion.</p> 
<p><img title="Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees" width="1280" height="720"></p> 
<p>To clear the <a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,all,count">current backlog</a>, a whopping 179 blocks would need to be mined. Given the average block time of 10 minutes, it would take approximately 1.24 days to mine the required number of blocks. This backlog has caused transaction fees to skyrocket by a whopping 343% over the past 11 days. As per bitinfocharts.com data, the average transaction fee currently stands at 0.00031 <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">$8.82 per transfer.</a></p> 
 
<p>Bitinfocharts.com further shows the median-sized Bitcoin transaction fee currently stands at 0.00018 <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html">$5.16 per transfer</a>. However, the situation is far from ideal, as per mempool.space. The website reveals that a low-priority fee will set you back $7.74, while a medium-priority fee costs $7.90.</p> 
<p>For those who need their transactions processed urgently, a high-priority fee of $7.99 per transfer. Adding to the frustration is the fact that the current block time is longer than the ten-minute average, with the last block taking a whopping ten minutes and 55 seconds to be discovered.</p> 
 
<p>The clogged mempool has been a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=mempool&amp;src=typed_query">hot topic on social media</a> lately, with users expressing a range of opinions on the matter. While some are excited about the surge in activity, others have labeled the rise of non-financial transactions as a DDoS or an attack.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin is not under attack.</p> 
<p>The anemic block size increases simply weren't sufficient to meet demand, and Lightning didn't see mass adoption.</p> 
<p>Quit whining. Either accept that a huge mempool and high fees will be the norm, or properly increase the block size.</p> 
<p>— Sam Patt (@SamuelPatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelPatt/status/1655195099142279168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Despite the optimism of some, the rise in unconfirmed transactions has not led to a significant increase in Lightning Network adoption. This is because it is still <a href="https://twitter.com/janowitz/status/1655141383487864836?s=20">expensive to open</a> and close a channel, and non-custodial solutions are<a href="https://twitter.com/TheDesertLynx/status/1645618834668175362?s=20"> few and far between</a>.</p> 
<p>At precisely 11:07 a.m. (ET), the largest crypto exchange in the world, as measured by trade volume, has temporarily halted bitcoin (<a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a>) withdrawals. The exchange has attributed this decision to a “congestion issue” that the Bitcoin network is currently grappling with.</p> 
<p>“Our team is currently working on a fix until the network is stabilized and will reopen <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> withdrawals as soon as possible. Rest assured, funds are SAFU,” Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655227965062672384?s=20">wrote</a> on Sunday morning.</p>

<title>A Lack of Alien Signals Actually Tells Us a Lot</title>
<link>https://www.universetoday.com/161238/a-lack-of-alien-signals-actually-tells-us-a-lot/</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In a  <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acc327">recent study</a> published in <em>The Astronomical Journal</em>, a researcher from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) discusses the potential reasons why we haven’t received technoemission, also called technosignatures, from an extraterrestrial intelligence during the 60 years that SETI has been searching, along with recommending additional methods as to how we can continue to search for such emissions.</p> 
 
 
 
<span></span> 
 
 
 
<p>Dr. Claudio Grimaldi, who is a guest scientist at the Laboratory of Statistical Biophysics at EPFL and sole author of the study, suggests that Earth has not received a technoemission simply because Earth could be in what he refers to as a “void space”, meaning the area of space that Earth resides in has been devoid of technoemissions.</p> 
 
 
<div>

Jansky Very Large Array</a> near Socorro, New Mexico, scanning the heavens for extraterrestrial technoemissions. (Credit: Jeff Hellermann/National Radio Astronomy Observatory/Associated Universities, Inc./National Science Foundation)</div> 
 
 
<p>“If it is true that we’ve been in a void region for sixty years, our model suggests that there are less than one to five electromagnetic emissions per century anywhere in our galaxy. This would make them about as rare as supernovas in the Milky Way,” <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/silence-reveals-insights-in-search-for-extraterres/">said Dr. Grimaldi</a>.</p> 
 
 
 
<p>For the study, Dr. Grimaldi developed a model that assumed the existence of technological “emitters” of extraterrestrial origin that are constantly broadcasting emissions and are equally dispersed throughout our Milky Way Galaxy. In the end, Dr. Grimaldi came up with three viewpoints of optimism regarding how long until Earth will detect a technoemission, which he refers to as a “crossing event”: an optimistic timeframe of 60 years from now, a moderately optimistic timeframe of 170 years from now, and a marginally optimistic timeframe of 1800 years from now.</p>

<img width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ata1_h.jpg" alt="">Image of the <a href="https://www.seti.org/ata">Allen Telescope Array</a> in Hat Creek, CA, scanning the skies for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. (Credit: Seth Shostak/SETI Institute)</div> 
 
 
<p>The study concludes by emphasizing the ideas presented could be either true or false but suggested that hunting for technoemissions should go beyond SETI searches while focusing on more “commensal investigations, i.e., searching for technosignals from data collected by telescopes performing other observational activities, rather than investing telescope time in active SETI searches.”</p> 
 
 
 
<p>One such option is the privately funded <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/1">Breakthrough Listen project</a> that is conducting the most extensive search for technoemissions to date, which was started in 2015 and is slated to run until 2025. Using radio telescopes that whose sensitivity is 50 times greater than current telescopes committed to searching for extraterrestrial intelligence, Breakthrough Listen is surveying 1,000,000 of the Earth’s closest stars, along with scanning the center of the Milky Way and what’s known as the galactic plane. The search even scans for emissions from 100 of the Milky Way’s closest galaxies. This study also comes as exoplanets are being discovered almost daily and <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/">over 5,300 have been confirmed</a> as of this writing.</p> 
 
 
 
<div> 
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="525" height="296" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Nllt9nRU1w?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;"></iframe> 
</div>Learn more about how Breakthrough Listen tried to <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/159219/astronomers-scanned-12-planets-for-alien-signals-while-they-were-in-front-of-their-stars/">detect technosignatures from 12 exoplanets</a> in 2022.  
 
 
 
<p>Dr. Grimaldi emphasizes that “the truth is, we don’t know where to search, at which frequencies and wavelengths. We are currently looking at other phenomena using our telescopes, so the best strategy might be to adopt the SETI community’s past approach of using data from other astrophysical studies – detecting radio emissions from other stars or galaxies – to see if they contain any techno-signals and make that the standard practice.”</p> 
 
 
 
<p>Two of the most profound ideas pertaining to why we haven’t detected a technoemission from an extraterrestrial intelligence are the <a href="https://www.seti.org/fermi-paradox-0">Fermi Paradox</a> and <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/39966/drake-equation-1/">Drake Equation</a>, and much like this recent study, both ideas present varying degrees of optimism about whether we’ll ever detect such a technoemission.</p> 
 
 
 
<p>While the Drake Equation presents a plethora of variables to attempt to calculate the number of extraterrestrial technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy, the Fermi Paradox presents a less optimistic argument as it is built on the question posed by Dr. Enrico Fermi, “where is everybody?”, while presenting hypothetical explanations for the reasons why we haven’t heard from such a civilization. One such explanation argues that civilizations inevitably destroy themselves in a short time after achieving technological milestones, including spaceflight or radio technology, which was also <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-many-aliens-are-in-the-milky-way-astronomers-turn-to-statistics-for-answers/">echoed by Dr. Carl Sagan</a>.</p> 
 
 
 
<div> 
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="525" height="296" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QgMGvgivCy8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;"></iframe> 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>Regarding the positive or negative interpretations of his conclusions, Dr. Grimaldi laughed saying, “This is something we need to think about. We may have been unlucky in that we discovered how to use radio telescopes just as we were crossing a portion of space in which electromagnetic signals from other civilizations were absent. To me, this hypothesis seems less extreme than assuming that we are constantly bombarded by signals from all sides but are, for some reason, unable to detect them.”</p> 
 
 
 
<p>Why haven’t we detected a signal from an extraterrestrial technological civilization and when will we? Are we truly alone in the universe, or is it teeming with civilizations like our own? Only time will tell, and this is why we science!</p> 
 
 
 
<p><em>As always, keep doing science &amp; keep looking up!</em></p>

<title>Deploying Your First Microservice to Kubernetes</title>
<link>https://dev.to/rinkiyakedad/deploying-your-first-microservice-to-kubernetes-ip1</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have <a href="https://dev.to/rinkiyakedad/series/16643">written</a> extensively about different Kubernetes concepts in my previous blogs, but I haven't covered a proper, step-by-step hands-on guide for getting started with Kubernetes. In this article, my plan is to do exactly that. After all, there's only so much you can learn by reading without trying things out yourself.</p> 
 
<p>We will take a simple microservice-based application, containerize it, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. I will be using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> for this, but you can use any cloud provider to follow along. Without wasting any more words, let's get started!</p> 
 
<h2> 
   
   
  The Application 
</h2> 
 
<p>I want to focus on the concepts of containerization and Kubernetes in this article, so to keep things easy to follow, we will work with a very simple Go server. Even if you've never worked with Go, the code should be pretty simple to understand.<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span>// main.go</span> 
 
<span>package</span> <span>main</span> 
 
<span>import</span> <span>(</span> 
    <span>"fmt"</span> 
    <span>"log"</span> 
    <span>"net/http"</span> 
<span>)</span> 
 
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> 
    <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>})</span> 
 
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Starting server at port 4000</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":4000"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>}</span> 
<span>}</span> 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>If you want to run this application locally, you first have to build the binary and then run it.<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span>$ </span>go build 
<span>$ </span>./simple-go-server 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, when you visit <a href="http://localhost:4000">localhost:4000</a>, you should see the text "Hello, World!" Pretty simple, right?</p> 
 
<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aGj68yOr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4v8nc6rc43wkoagh1mb9.png"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aGj68yOr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4v8nc6rc43wkoagh1mb9.png" alt="hello world from localhost" width="532" height="234"></a></p> 
 
<p>Now let's work on containerizing this Go service.</p> 
 
<h2> 
   
   
  Containerizing Our Application 
</h2> 
 
<p>Kubernetes does not run applications directly. You cannot simply instruct it to build the binary and start serving the application. Instead, it is a tool for running and managing containers (in fact, it doesn't run containers directly, but more on that later). Therefore, we need to containerize our application before we can proceed to running it on a Kubernetes cluster.</p> 
 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you are not familiar with containers and Dockerfiles, I recommend checking out my <a href="https://dev.to/rinkiyakedad/series/10009">article series</a> on Docker before proceeding.</p> 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>Let's write a Dockerfile for our application. At the root folder of the application, create the following file:<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span># Dockerfile</span> 
 
<span>FROM</span><span> golang:buster</span> 
 
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span> 
<span>ADD</span><span> . .</span> 
<span>RUN </span>go build <span>-o</span> /usr/local/bin/simple-go-server 
 
<span>EXPOSE</span><span> 4000</span> 
<span>CMD</span><span> ["/usr/local/bin/simple-go-server"]</span> 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>Assuming you have some familiarity with <a href="https://dev.to/rinkiyakedad/learning-to-use-docker-298b#dockerfile">Dockerfiles</a>, this one should be fairly easy to understand. We use a <code>golang</code> base image to ensure that Go and all required dependencies are present in our container from the start.</p> 
 
<p>After setting the working directory, we move our application's code (the <code>main.go</code> file in this case) to this location. We then execute the <code>go build</code> command to build the binary from our code and output it at <code>/usr/local/bin/simple-go-server</code>. Finally, we specify that the container should listen for requests on <code>port 4000</code>, which is the port our API service runs on.</p> 
 
<p>As the last step, we simply run the binary we had previously created.</p> 
 
<p>To verify that everything is working as expected, build a container image from this Dockerfile and run it.<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span>$ </span>docker build <span>-t</span> &lt;your-dockerhub-username&gt;/simple-go-server <span>.</span> 
<span>$ </span>docker run <span>--rm</span> <span>--name</span> simple-go-server <span>-p</span> 4000:4000 &lt;your-dockerhub-username&gt;/simple-go-server 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>In the <code>docker run</code> command, we map the container's port <code>4000</code> to the port <code>4000</code> of our local machine. After running this command, if you visit <a href="http://localhost:4000">localhost:4000</a>, you should see the text as we did when we ran the application after building the binary locally.</p> 
 
<p>Now that we have containerized our Go service, let's see how we can run it on an actual Kubernetes cluster!</p> 
 
<h2> 
   
   
  Running Our Microservice on Kubernetes 
</h2> 
 
<p>To avoid writing an excessively long article, I will not cover the steps for creating a Kubernetes cluster in a cloud provider and obtaining your kubectl credentials. However, if you are using GCP like I am, you can find those steps <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl">here</a>. A similar guide should be easy to find for any other cloud provider you might be using.</p> 
 
<p>Assuming you have kubectl configured to work with your cluster, the first step is to write some manifests. Kubernetes works on a declarative model. You specify what "objects" you need, and then Kubernetes works to make the current state of the system match the desired state. We will specify what we need by writing two YAML manifests.</p> 
 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you are not familiar with Kubernetes, I recommend checking out <a href="https://dev.to/okteto/fundamental-kubernetes-concepts-everyone-needs-to-know-mm7">this article</a> before proceeding.</p> 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>The first manifest we will create is:<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span># k8s/deployment.yaml</span> 
 
<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>apps/v1</span> 
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Deployment</span> 
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>simple-go-server</span> 
<span>spec</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>replicas</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> 
  <span>selector</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>matchLabels</span><span>:</span> 
      <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>simple-go-server</span> 
  <span>template</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>metadata</span><span>:</span> 
      <span>labels</span><span>:</span> 
        <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>simple-go-server</span> 
    <span>spec</span><span>:</span> 
      <span>containers</span><span>:</span> 
        <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>simple-go-server</span> 
          <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>&lt;your-dockerhub-username&gt;/simple-go-server</span> 
          <span>ports</span><span>:</span> 
            <span>-</span> <span>containerPort</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span> 
          <span>imagePullPolicy</span><span>:</span> <span>Always</span> 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>As mentioned earlier, Kubernetes does not directly run containers. Instead, it runs something called Pods. Pods encapsulate containers, meaning that a Pod can contain one or more containers, and each container in a Pod runs in its own isolated process namespace within the Pod.</p> 
 
<p>However, if you look at the <code>kind</code> field in our manifest, you'll notice that we're not telling Kubernetes to create Pods for us. This is because Pods alone won't provide us with much value.</p> 
 
<p>A pod can go down due to any number of reasons, which would make our application inaccessible to users. Similarly, we might need more or fewer pods in the future depending on the load on our application. If we simply tell Kubernetes to create a fixed number of pods, scaling won't be easy. Nor will updating the application when we release a newer version of our Hello World API. This is why we create an object called Deployment instead of Pods.</p> 
 
<p>A Deployment is a higher-level object than Pods and is used to manage a set of identical pods. We tell Kubernetes the number of Pods we want it to always have up and running for our application under the <code>replicas</code> field. If any number of these Pods goes down for any reason, Kubernetes will automatically try to bring up another Pod until the number matches what we had requested. We won't go into the details here, but Deployments also have other benefits, like allowing you to perform rolling updates to your application and change the number of Pods based on the traffic your application receives. This is why we always prefer Deployments over Pods. Under <code>spec.template.spec.containers</code>, we provide information about what containers should be running inside the Pods the Deployment creates for us. With this, Kubernetes has everything it needs to run our application. But the story doesn't end here.</p> 
 
<p>Creating the above Deployment in Kubernetes will run your application in the cluster. However, a problem that remains unsolved is how your users can access it. We need Kubernetes to provide us an endpoint where users can access this application. To achieve this, we need to leverage another Kubernetes object called Service. You can read more about Services in detail <a href="https://dev.to/rinkiyakedad/networking-in-kubernetes-1eci">here</a>.<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span># k8s/service.yaml</span> 
 
<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>v1</span> 
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Service</span> 
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>simple-go-server</span> 
<span>spec</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>selector</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>simple-go-server</span> 
  <span>ports</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>http</span> 
      <span>port</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span> 
      <span>targetPort</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span> 
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>LoadBalancer</span> 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>As discussed earlier, Pods are ephemeral, which means that we cannot rely on their IP addresses to expose the application since they can stop existing at any point. The Service object helps solve this problem by providing a stable IP address for the Pods part of our deployment (which we specify under the <code>selector</code> field). This way, users can discover them without having to know the exact IP addresses of individual Pods.</p> 
 
<p>It is important to choose the correct <code>type</code> of service since Kubernetes has different types of services, each with its own goals. The <code>LoadBalancer</code> service type is used when we want to provide external access to our application. When we create this Service object, Kubernetes asks our cloud provider (in this case, GCP) to create a load balancer for us. This load balancer has a fixed IP address that can be used to access the application.</p> 
 
<p>Enough with the explanation, let's see things in action!</p> 
 
<h2> 
   
   
  Trying Out Our Application. 
</h2> 
 
<p>Assuming you have placed both manifests we wrote in a folder called <code>k8s</code>, you can create the objects by running the following command:<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span>$ </span>kubectl apply <span>-f</span> k8s 
</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>To confirm that all objects have been created, run:<br> 
</p> 
 
<div> 
<pre><code><span>$ </span>kubectl get all 
 
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

service/kubernetes         ClusterIP      10.120.32.1     &lt;none&gt;          443/TCP        157d 
service/simple-go-server   LoadBalancer   10.120.46.108   35.246.20.168   80:31225/TCP   4m51s

</code></pre> 
 
</div> 
 
 
 
<p>As you can see, our Deployment object has created a Pod for us. The ReplicaSet object you see is also created by the Deployment, but only to manage the Pods it creates. Additionally, the <code>simple-go-server</code> service is running. Copy the <code>EXTERNAL-IP</code> you see for this service and visit that address in your browser.</p> 
 
<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5_DwwD_6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hp5f3gi0o0g3qkbggnqv.png"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5_DwwD_6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hp5f3gi0o0g3qkbggnqv.png" alt="hello world from load balancer" width="372" height="134"></a></p> 
 
<p>And voila! Our application is now up and running and accessible. You can share this IP address with anyone, or even map it to a domain name to make your microservice easily accessible for users.</p> 
 
<h2> 
   
   
  Conclusion

<p>In this article, we deployed a simple microservice to a Kubernetes cluster from scratch. I hope you found this article useful and that it helped you see some of the Kubernetes concepts we have discussed theoretically in action.

<title>ChatGPT is Powered by $15-an-Hour Contractors</title>
<link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/23/05/07/0346253/chatgpt-is-powered-by-15-an-hour-contractors?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/ai_64.png" alt="ai_64.png"></p>An anonymous reader shared this report from NBC News:  
  
Alexej Savreux, a 34-year-old in Kansas City, says he's done all kinds of work over the years. He's made fast-food sandwiches. He's been a custodian and a junk-hauler. And he's done technical sound work for live theater.   
  
These days, though, his work is less hands-on: He's an artificial intelligence trainer.   
  
Savreux is part of a hidden army of contract workers who have been doing the behind-the-scenes labor of teaching AI systems how to analyze data so they can generate the kinds of text and images that have wowed the people using newly popular products like ChatGPT. To improve the accuracy of AI, he has labeled photos and made predictions about what text the apps should generate next.   
  
The pay: $15 an hour and up, with no benefits... He credits the AI gig work — along with a previous job at the sandwich chain Jimmy John's — with helping to pull him out of homelessness.   
  
"Their feedback fills an urgent and endless need for the company and its AI competitors: providing streams of sentences, labels and other information that serve as training data," the article explains:  
"A lot of the discourse around AI is very congratulatory," said Sonam Jindal, the program lead for AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that promotes research and education around artificial intelligence. "But we're missing a big part of the story: that this is still hugely reliant on a large human workforce," she said...   
  
A spike in demand has arrived, and some AI contract workers are asking for more. In Nairobi, Kenya, more than 150 people who've worked on AI for Facebook, TikTok and ChatGPT voted Monday to form a union, citing low pay and the mental toll of the work, Time magazine reported...
